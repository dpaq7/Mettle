***

To think of these classes collectively, consider them as specialized gears in a complex clockwork machine. The **Fury** is the swinging pendulum generating raw momentum, while the **Tactician** is the main cog coordinating every minute movement. The **Censor** and **Conduit** represent the essential divine structure ensuring the machine operates with moral force, opposite the chaos unleashed by the **Elementalist**'s pure power and the subtle distortions introduced by the **Shadow**. The **Null** acts as a metaphysical shock absorber, protecting the delicate mechanisms, while the **Talent** attempts to wind the whole clock faster—even at the risk of breaking it. Finally, the **Summoner** turns small components (minions) into entire working sub-assemblies, and the **Troubadour** ensures the machine's operation is always the most dramatic story told.
